I integrated FontAwesome for icons and used Bootstrap along with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design. HTTP requests were handled with React-Axios, and I optimized the project through React Scripts from Create React App. I implemented tests with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and used TypeScript for clean, well-structured code, measured and optimized."
